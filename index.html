      <h2>Predecessors of Mass Printing</h2>
      <p>The earliest form of printing an exact image multiple times came in the form of stamps and seals.  The most ancient artifacts that display the use of these tools come from Ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian societies. They would take an engraved tool with a complex image and press it into wet clay.  A technique that came later and was used predominantly in East Asia was Wood Printing. This was one of the earliest forms of mass printing.  To utilize this technique, one would carve their text or picture in a flat block of wood, cover the carving in ink and press it on the fabric they wished their picture to be on. Another Wood Printing technique involves the reverse.  One would place the block face side up on a table, with the paper or fabric on top. The back of the paper or fabric is rubbed with a hard pad, a flat piece of wood, a burnisher, or a leather frotton. </p>
