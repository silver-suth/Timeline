      <h2>Predecessors of Mass Printing</h2>
      <p>The earliest form of printing an exact image multiple times came in the form of stamps and seals.  The most ancient artifacts that display the use of these tools come from Ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian societies. They would take an engraved tool with a complex image and press it into wet clay.  A technique that came later and was used predominantly in East Asia was Wood Printing. This was one of the earliest forms of mass printing.  To utilize this technique, one would carve their text or picture in a flat block of wood, cover the carving in ink and press it on the fabric they wished their picture to be on. Another Wood Printing technique involves the reverse.  One would place the block face side up on a table, with the paper or fabric on top. The back of the paper or fabric is rubbed with a hard pad, a flat piece of wood, a burnisher, or a leather frotton. </p>

      <h2>The Printing Press</h2>
      <p>A moveable-type printing press was invented in South Korea. The revolutionary thing about this machine was the aspect of moveable type, which allowed the user to print different pages with a single machine. In Renaissance Europe, Johannes Gutenberg independently made a similar contraption.  This started a printing revolution that lasted until the early 20th century. Gutenberg’s added innovation of the hand mould allowed for the fast production of the type needed for the machine. Gutenberg’s two innovations gave Europe the ability to fashion books cheaply and in mass quantities.  In Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication, which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. </p>

      <h2>The Line Printer</h2>
      <p>While multiple designs and adjustments were added to the Printing Press since its initial creation, one of the most important was crafted in 1950.  The first design of the line printer still used the application of pressure to print on a medium but it was much faster as they print whole lines at one time.  There are many designs for line printers including early forms of laser printing used in common households today but there are similar characteristics. timing of the hammers was critical, and was adjustable as part of the servicing of the printer. Incorrect timing of the hammer resulted in printed lines that wandered vertically. Most of these printers had the capability to print 132 lines of text though some could only do 80 lines. </p>

      <h2>The Modern Printer</h2>
      <p>There are a wide variety of modern printers. Categories of common modern printers include Toner Based Printers, Liquid Inkjet Printers, and Solid Ink Printers. Toner based printers utilize laser technology rapidly produces high quality text and graphics. As with digital photocopiers and multifunction printers, laser printers employ a xerographic printing process but differ from analog photocopiers in that the image is produced by the direct scanning of a laser beam across the printer's photoreceptor. Liquid inkjet printers operate by propelling variably sized droplets of liquid ink onto almost any sized page. Solid ink printers use solid sticks of CMYK-colored ink, similar in consistency to candle wax, which are melted and fed into a piezo crystal operated print-head. The printhead sprays the ink on a rotating, oil coated drum. The paper then passes over the print drum, at which time the image is immediately transferred, or transfixed, to the page. Solid ink printers are most commonly used as color office printers, and are excellent at printing on transparencies and other non-porous media.</p>

    <div class="Section5" description "3D Printer">
      <h2>3D Printer</h2>
      <p>3D printing has taken printing to new heights.  Rather than being confined to a two-dimensional medium, people can now mass print practical items out of various materials. One of the key advantages of 3D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries, and a prerequisite for producing any 3D printed part is a digital 3D model or a CAD file. 3D printers take these files and, through the extruder, extrudes rapidly drying filament layer by layer until the product is complete. The Earliest concept of 3D printing came from James E H Jones in 1947, and until recent years the technology was used only for quick architectural models and research. As mentioned before, 3D printers must have a digital 3D model or CAD file to operate meaning 3D prints are very computer oriented. This technology has advanced to the point where people are printing the walls of houses out of concrete in third world countries. </p>
